# ChatX
Simple free PHP &amp; jQuery chat project with flat file database

<h1>Demo <a href="https://codepen.io/C3La-NS/full/jOZpgRW">on CodePen</a><h1>

<h2>What is ChatX?</h2>
ChatX is an advanced and sophisticated iteration of the original ShoutBox script, initially introduced on <a href="https://tutorialzine.com/2015/01/shoutbox-php-jquery">Tutorialzine</a> in 2015.
<br />
This script utilizes a flat file database and harnesses the power of <a href="https://github.com/jamesmoss/flywheel">Flywheel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mpratt/RelativeTime">RelativeTime</a> PHP libraries to provide a seamless and efficient user experience. It is user-friendly, easy to install and modify, and compatible with nearly all hosting services.
<br />
The idea behind the development of ChatX was to create an easy-to-use compact chat widget with fully-customizable color schemes, capable of working on any web-site with the code installed.

<h2>Why ChatX?</h2>
<br />
One of the key features of ChatX is its accessibility and convenience. The chat remains on the screen and is always within reach, even while navigating the website. It is easy to drag and resize the widget within the browser viewport, and it can be expanded or minimized to suit your needs. The chat also remembers its state, so you don't have to readjust it each time you use it.
<br />
Another benefit of ChatX is its ease of installation. There is no need for complex setups or MySQL or other databases. Just unzip the archive on your hosting and you're ready to go. The script is compatible with PHP 7.0+, making it suitable even for free web hosting services.
<br />
Despite its simplicity, ChatX offers all the main features of a regular chat. You can easily manage the chat's global functions without needing to understand JavaScript or PHP coding.
<br />
It's free, without any ads or distracting copyrights, and we continuously work to improve the user experience.

a) Expand the widget;
<br />
b) Click on <b>Gear</b> icon <b>â†’</b> <b>Login</b>;
<br />

<br />
e) In the new tab follow the steps provided in the left sidebar.
<br />
<br />
If done ChatX must work correctly on any website.
